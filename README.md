# Fake-News-Predictor-Project
### Overall Goal of the project: This project deals with some most important NLP techniques such as Bag of Words representation and its application to predict whether a news is fake or not.
### Machine Learning:
* Use CountVectorizer() to create the Bag of Words representation of each news and to build a prediction model using Multinomial Naive bayes (MultinomialNB()) algorithm in the sklearn module.
### Technologies used:
* Python - pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, CountVectorizer() etc.
